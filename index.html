          He was the second born of two children to Margie and Herb Star. Sam
          was lost at sea when she and Patrick were children. He did not see her
          again until the episode "Big Sister Sam." In the same episode, he
          mentions how Sam was his 'rock' when they were younger and how she
          looked out for him, implying they were somehow separated from their
          parents when Patrick was a baby. However, in "I'm With Stupid", he can
          immediately recognize his parents and it's implied they are not
          long-lost. Patrick met SpongeBob when the two were babies, as shown in
          "The Secret Box."[21]. When he was a kid, Patrick tended to recite
          poems during gym class, which ruined his reputation and made him a
          target for dodgeball players, as shown in "Sing a Song of
          Patrick."[22] When he was an adult, he moved out and rented a rock
          house eventually to own it. He lives next door to Squidward. As
          revealed in "Home Sweet Pineapple," Patrick was kicked out of his
          parents' house at one point and never allowed to come back. He thus
          created his rock, with the only difference being that he added a
          satellite antenna to it.[23] At some point, Patrick went to community
          college with Flats the Flounder, although he forgets what he studied
          there and likely failed to graduate.[24] Patrick celebrated two
          unspecified birthdays in the episodes "The Donut of Shame" and
          "Overbooked." One day, when his neighbor Squidward was gardening, a
          pineapple fell from a ship into the ocean, landing on Squidward's
          garden creating the pineapple house. Meanwhile, SpongeBob was looking
          for a house of his own; when all hope seemed lost, SpongeBob and the
          real estate agent saw the pineapple house's creation and Patty said
          she had forgotten about the house. SpongeBob bought it. To this day,
          they have been neighbors.[25] Later, in the episode "Driven to Tears,"
          he gained but lost his driver's license, and threw his Bass Blaster
          3000 away from that he won. At some point, Patrick learned how to put
          on a diaper. At some point, he met Grandma SquarePants. At some point,
          he wrote I Wrote This and submitted it to Bigshot Records for $100, to
          make it into a song.[22] He once rented out his front yard to a fish
          named Howard in "New Fish in Town." He, along with SpongeBob,
          Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and Plankton became superheroes while on
          land to retrieve the Krabby Patty secret formula from Burger Beard.
